### About Myself

My acquaintance with frontend development happened about a year ago. And from the first steps I really fell in love with it. I really like to make up websites and immediately see the result. I have also always loved solving logic tasks, and I am very inspired by working in a team.

At first I studied by myself, using textbooks and available information from the Internet. When that wasn't enough, I went to study at the GeekBrains online University at the Frontend Development department. After six months of studying, I wanted to expand my skills in JavaScript practice. And by a lucky chance I came across the RS School.

My immediate goals are to deepen and consolidate my knowledge in this area and get a job in the second half of 2022. And in the future I plan to realize my full potential in this profession.
